1) Define the order-event contract
2) Create deterministic JSON fixtures using SQL
3) Unload files to an internal stage and verify their contents


-- The goal: prepare repeatable event data and establish the landing area for the ingestion pipeline.

Students should finish with:
- A known set of sample events.
- JSON files generated from those events in an internal stage.
- Verification that they can list the files and query their contents.

-- BUSINESS SCENARIO
-- Imagine an online retailer receiving purchase orders from customers.
-- The source order-management system sends a full snapshot whenever an order
-- is placed, revised, paid, or cancelled. We simulate those messages with SQL.
-- This is a simplified teaching model: no customer, item, tax, or payment detail.
-- All amounts are USD. Region is the order's business region, not a cloud region.
-- The downstream active-order total includes PLACED and PAID orders and excludes
-- CANCELLED orders. It is current active order value, not recognized revenue.


-- PAYLOAD CONTRACT: one JSON object describes one order-state event.
-- event_id   : Identity of an immutable message (for example, e4).
--              A repeated delivery keeps the same event_id and payload.
--              Different payloads for the same event_id are a conflict.
-- order_id   : Identity of the purchase order (for example, o1).
--              Several distinct events can describe changes to the same order.
-- version    : Positive integer revision of that order's business state.
--              The source system assigns it separately for each order.
--              Version 2 of o1 supersedes version 1 of o1, regardless of when
--              the messages reach Snowflake. Versions across orders are unrelated.
--              This is not a schema version, table version, or Snowflake metadata.
-- event_time : UTC time of the source business event, not its ingestion time.
-- status     : PLACED (submitted), PAID (payment recorded), or CANCELLED.
-- amount     : Full USD amount of the order at this revision, supplied as a string.
--              Silver converts and validates it; "oops" deliberately fails.
-- region     : US or EU; later used for aggregation and governed visibility.


-- EXAMPLE: o1 version 1 is PLACED for $100; version 2 is PAID for $120.
-- Imagine the customer changed the order before paying. The newer snapshot
-- replaces the earlier state: current amount is $120, not $100 + $120.
-- Each message is a complete snapshot, not a payment transaction or amount delta.
-- A cancellation remains as the latest state (a tombstone), so an old message
-- cannot make that order active again. Its retained amount is excluded from
-- the active-order total rather than deleted from the order history.


-- FIXTURE is controlled sample data, not the production ingestion destination.
-- batch selects the generated input file; it is outside the JSON payload.
-- payload stores the parsed JSON object as VARIANT. Only payload is unloaded.
-- The eight rows below form two four-row deliveries, not eight distinct orders.
-- Files may contain records in any order; precedence comes from the contract.

-- e7: a delayed older snapshot of o1 ($90, version 1) arrives in batch 2.
-- It has a different event_id from e1, so it is not an exact-event duplicate.
-- It must not overwrite version 2. The fixture intentionally also exercises
-- equal-version precedence; Silver uses event_time, then event_id as a classroom
-- tie-breaker. A production source contract should reject ambiguous revisions.

The intended responsibilities:

FIXTURE table:	    Controlled sample data used to generate reproducible input batches.
EVENTS_STAGE:	    Landing area containing JSON files that later ingestion exercises load.
EVENTS_RAW table: 	Created in Lab 02, where files are loaded into Bronze.
EVENTS_STREAM:	    Created before the first load in Lab 02; tracks raw inserts.


Lab 01 finishes with reproducible JSON files on the internal stage.
Lab 02 creates the ingestion target and stream immediately before loading.
The append-only stream refresher is included with its creation in Lab 02.
