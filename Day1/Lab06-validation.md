# Lab 06 validation - 2026-10-12

Isolated live Snowflake rehearsal; student ADV_ORDERS was not changed.

- Notebook transformation and rollback cells ran in Snowflake Python 3.12 as a temporary rehearsal stored-procedure wrapper, using the same cell source. Only session acquisition/context were adapted. All assertions passed.
- Unpinned Snowpark dependency resolved at deployment; see execution evidence below for the actual version.
- Initial input/inbox 10; current 3; active value 165; pending 0. Trial scratch writes rolled back.
- Procedure setup/handler rerun passed. Synthetic replay produced raw/inbox 11, scratch events 11, current 3, active value 165 and pending 0. Repeating replay did not add another row.
- Snowpark MERGE restored one deliberately missing order and one deliberately older order state.
- Conflicting e4 payload raised an exception: inbox remained 11, raw 12, pending stream 1, current 3 and active value 165. Transaction rollback preserved stream availability.
- Rehearsal warehouse suspended afterwards.

Not tested: hosted notebook UI import/runtime, optional headless notebook task, and task-graph execution in this rehearsal. These require an account rehearsal; do not present them as passed. Snowpipe was bypassed by SQL-seeded Bronze input in this test.

## Instructor notebook adoption - 12 October 2026

Retained the instructor 24-cell structure, SQL cell metadata, whitespace and df/df_* parameter naming. Applied equivalent formatting and parameter naming to deployment source. VERSION now intentionally uses NUMBER(3,1), a classroom simplification approved by the instructor. Numeric conversion can round additional fractional digits and rejects values outside this precision; full arbitrary-input validation is not claimed. Fresh scratch-table DDL uses this type; existing scratch tables are preserved by IF NOT EXISTS.

Live isolated rehearsal in ADE_LAB6_STYLE_20261012_010951: Python development cells and rollback assertions passed; the assembled handler passed two calls; current orders=3, active value=165 and stream=0. Inputs were copied from the accepted 11-delivery inbox. The conflict view was an empty fixture: no new conflict-guard test is claimed. Hosted notebook UI import/execution and optional notebook task were not tested. Warehouse suspended afterwards.
